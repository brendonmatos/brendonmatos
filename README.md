# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am addicted to solving problems for developers and individuals, creating tech tools that make a meaningful impact. With a mix of professionalism, empathy, and a touch of humor, I have been approaching challenges with enthusiasm and dedication. My mantra is to keep always learning and discovering so that I will stay at the forefront of technology to deliver cutting-edge solutions, solving efficiently client issues. 

My current focus is creating tools that make a difference for people. From creating software useful to clients to creating software for developers.

> Be kind, be useful, and be happy. That is all that matters.
